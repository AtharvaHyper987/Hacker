        <h3 style="color:white;">What is a hacker?</h3>
        <p style="color:white;">A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves.[1][2] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare.</p>
        <h3 style="color:white;">Definition of hackers</h3>
        <p style="color:white; font-size:20;">Reflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word "hacker":</p>
        <p style="color:white;">1. Originally, hacker simply meant advanced computer technology enthusiast (both hardware and software) and adherent of programming subculture; see hacker culture.</p>
        <p style="color:white;">2. Someone who is able to subvert computer security. If doing so for malicious purposes, the person can also be called a cracker.</p>
        <h3 style="color:white;">What do Hackers do?</h3>
        <p style="color:white;">A hacker is a person who breaks into a computer system. The reasons for hacking can be many: installing malware, stealing or destroying data, disrupting service, and more. Hacking can also be done for ethical reasons, such as trying to find software vulnerabilities so they can be fixed.Hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and even entire networks. Hackers are motivated by personal gain, to make a statement, or just because they can.</p>
